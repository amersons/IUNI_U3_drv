   * Emitted when faces are present in the input images to Engine#handleImage().

   * Whenever a new face is detected in an input image, a %FacePresence
   * object with the Action START is emitted. After that, a %FacePresence
   * object with the Action MOVEMENT is emitted for every input image in which
   * the face is still seen. When the open hand is no longer found in the
   * input images, a %FacePresence object with the Action END is sent.
   * After that, no more %FacePresence objects are sent for that object id,
   * but objects with a new id will be sent if a face is again seen in the input images.
