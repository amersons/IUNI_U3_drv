   * object with the Action START is emitted. After that, an %OpenHandPresence
   * object with the Action MOVEMENT is emitted for every input image in which
   * the open hand is still seen. When the open hand is no longer found in the
   * input images, an %OpenHandPresence object with the Action END is sent.
   * After that, no more %OpenHandPresence objects are sent for that object id,
   * but objects with a new id will be sent if an open hand is again seen in the input images.
